		Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
		And sorry I could not travel both<br>
		And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
		And looked down as far as I could<br>
		To where it bent in the undergrowth<br><br>
		Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
		And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
		Though as for that the passing there<br>
		Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>
		And both that morning equally lay<br>
		In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
		Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
		I doubted if I should ever come back.<br><br>
		I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br>
		I took the one less traveled by,<br>
		And that has made all the difference.
